There's a meta-contrarian idea that the mechanisms of academia exclude some
really good science that's just too unconventional. This is not true to the
extent claimed.
<!-- Tyler Cowen said something like this somewhere. -->

Computer algebra is useful but discovering new algorithms to automate
mathematical work is hard.

As Robin Hanson and Steve Levitt say, life is long. There's lots of time to
do lots of different things.

Juergen Schmidhuber is right<!-- and Tyler Cowen is wrong-->: China will surpass
the US in dominance this century.

[Here](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/gamblesuits.html) Robin Hanson
proposes a much more efficient method of small claims resolution.
The Enlightenment was about such ideas: approaching economic problems
rationally where previously no one realized there was a problem.

The rapid decision-making abilities of basketball and soccer players impress me
as much as their physical skills.

"Up to 40%" of travelers from developed to developing countries get travelers'
diarrhea; "in the normal population 1% to 2% of persons per year will develop
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), while 5% to 6% of travelers after traveler’s
diarrhea will develop IBS"; and "the prevalence of depression and anxiety in
IBS patients is 37.1 and 31.4% respectively".

The Princeton Companion to Mathematics says "algebraists like to work with exact
formulas and analysts use estimates. Or, to put it even more succinctly,
algebraists like equalities and analysts like inequalities". In computer
science, algebraists like programming languages and analysts like algorithms and
complexity. Or, to put it even more succinctly, algebraists like lambda calculus
and analysts like Turing machines.

During retirement, write a memoir to be read by your descendants
if no one else.

Mathematics, to a first approximation, is a 20th century phenomenon.
